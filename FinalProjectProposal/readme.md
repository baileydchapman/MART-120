For my final project I want to create a game where a dog collects treats and meets friends along the way. The dogs will look like my dogs.

The game will resemble the code of P5

The biggest problem that I will have will be making the dogs resemble my actual dogs.

I will work a little every day to complete this on time.

I have not started this yet, as I have finals due for other classes as well. I plan to start on Tuesday night.
